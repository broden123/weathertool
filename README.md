# Weather Tool

## Description

This Weather tool can pull 5-day weather forecasts for inputted cities. THe tool will also save inputted cities to local storage and create a table to redownlaod data from previous searches. Future development of the tool will include style to make the webpage more appealing (and dynamically load the table upon first search) and configuring the search history to append the table on search rather than page reload.
